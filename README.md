# U.S. Retail Sales Predictions 
Time Series Analysis with exponential smoothing 

## Objective 
Build an exponential smoothing model to predict retail sales. 

## How to Run 
```
git clone https://github.com/cbotts/exponential_smoothing/
jupyter notebook /exponential_smoothing/Botts_ES_Sales.ipynb
```

## Data 
Data includes sales information from a U.S. store from the years 1992-2021. 

## Methods 
Data was transposed and a datetime feature created to prepare the data for time series analysis. An exponential smoothing model was built and hyperparameters tuned to reduce RMSE.
